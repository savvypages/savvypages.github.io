            <p>My name is Maria and I am a native San Franciscan. Given that coding involves many hours of practice, reviewing and researching the solution, I have decided to relive my most favorite hobby and that includes playing with  dogs. This for me provides great comfort and puts my anxiety at ease. A time to break away from the screen is what my mind needs.</p>

            <h3>How to get started</h3>

            <p>The best way to get started would be by visiting your local animal shelter to sign up. To find a location, you can search online for your nearest shelter by visiting <a href="https://www.animalshelter.org/" target="_blank" rel="animal shelter database">AnimalShelter.org</a>. This database includes over 6,000 organizations so finding a shelter within your reach should be easy. Just follow the simple instructions below:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Visit <a href="https://www.animalshelter.org/" target="_blank" rel="animal shelter database">AnimalShelter.org</a></li>
                    <li>Click the Animal Shelters tab</li>
                    <li>Enter your Zip Code</li>
                    <li>Select the Radius</li>
                    <li>Click the Find button</li>
                </ol>

            <img src="lab_schnauzer.png" width="350" height="250" alt="white dog with leash">

            <p>The results page will provide you with comparable listings noting the contact information for each shelter. You can contact the shelter directly to request information on how to begin voluneering or by checking their website for specific instructions. For example, the <a href="https://www.sfanimalcare.org/volunteer/" target="_blank" rel="San Francisco Animal Care and Control shelter">San Francisco Animal Care & Control</a> provides various ways in which you can volunteer either in person at the shelter or by fostering a pet at home. Each shelter has its own criteria on how to qualify. Most often it includes a simple application and an orientation. You will then receive training on proper care.  Rest assured that at most all you need is time and a loving heart.</p>

            <p>At any shelter, you will find different dog breeds with various energy levels. It is best to select from one you feel most comfortable working with. Volunteering may include playtime in the visiting room, a walk around the block or just by simply giving treats. If dogs are not your preference, luckily there are many other type of animals ranging from cats, rabbits, birds, mice and even reptiles. The shelters are often shorthanded so any assistance provided is always appreciated.</p>

            <p>Should you ever be interested in adopting an animal, I highly recommend taking part in the <a href="https://www.cleartheshelters.com/clear-the-shelters/clear-the-shelters-2022-what-to-know-to-adopt-and-donate/1913424/" target="_blank" rel="clear the shelters event">Clear The Shelters</a> event that takes place twice a year nationwide. In order to reduce the number of crowded shelters, the adoptions fees for all animals waived. Free pets anyone?</p>
            <p>Hope to see you there.</p>
